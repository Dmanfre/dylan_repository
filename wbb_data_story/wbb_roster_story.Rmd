Establishing my steps

```{r}

# What are my steps here and can I create a loop from it?
# import the dataset wbb_rosters_22_23
# establish the power_five list power_five <- c("SEC", "Big Ten", "Pac-12", "Big 12", "ACC")

#Try to set this up so that the code is underneith a sentence that I would write in the story. 


```

*** Genearl notes *****

Thinking of making this story more of a listical piece where I provide a graphic that answers questions I have when writing the code and analyzing the data. Each section of the story would be an answered question about the women's basketball data. And all of them will be relating back to Maryland or Power 5 at large.


General questions
- Do I start national and work down to a more local level?
- Do I include schools that are moving into the Big Ten in the latest 23-24 data?
- How do I work in the census data to get per capita numbers (look back at the textbook and previous labs)


Steps
- Generate the numbers per capita for the state and then the local towns
- Get state populations by using Census API 
- Begin writing the questions for the story
- Start national and then work down




Story questions to be analyzed by the data (In no particular order)
- Where to women's basketball players in Maryland come from
- Where do Big 10 players come from in Maryland?
- Which county or state produces the most women's basketball players?
- How many Power 5 players are there in Maryland?
- Which state has the most WBB players per capita?
- How many DI, II and III players are there. 


Story Structure (Start wide and work your way in)
- National numbers
- Maryland state numbers
- Basketball centric numbers: ie: Big 10, Division I etc.




Presentation ideas
- Vision is tha you click on a part of the map and then it zooms in on an area and you're able to or click on a filter like the first graphic in the Ramaswamy story

*** Organized section


```{r}
#What I want to do here is make a value that says power_five and have that be equal to "Big Ten", "Big 12", "ACC", "SEC', "Pac-12" so that when I filter I can say Filter to show me only players in the power_five conferences.

power_five <- c("SEC", "Big Ten", "Pac-12", "Big 12", "ACC")

wbb_rosters_22_23 %>%
filter(conference == power_five)
#174 players are from Power 5 schools
#Question: should I include the new incoming Big Ten teams into this code block?


```

Working Lede: With women's basketball season approaching, let's see where players come form within the US and abroad. While Maryland lost a plethora of talent, including three of its starters, the Terps have a good crop of experience and newcomers to work with.

** Running some basic analysis unorganized**


```{r}
#Question: How many women's basketball players are from Maryland?
#Answer: Maryland has 350 WBB players?

#state counts
wbb_rosters_22_23 %>% 
group_by(state_clean) %>%
filter(state_clean == "MD") %>% 
count()
##Maryland has 350
```


```{r}
#Question: What state has the most WBB players
#Answer: PA has the most with 915
#Sentence: There are over 1,000 players who hail from overseas (say some of the best international names), but Pennsylvania, New York and Texas dominate the domestic states with 915, 900 and 992 players respectively.

state_counts <- wbb_rosters_22_23 %>% 
group_by(state_clean) %>%
count() %>% 
arrange(desc(n))
#1073 NAs

international_players <- wbb_rosters_22_23 %>% 
filter(is.na(state_clean))
```





```{r}
#Question: Which power 5 conference produces the most WBB players?
#Answer:
#Sentence:

wbb_rosters_22_23 %>%
filter(conference == power_five) %>% 
group_by(conference) %>% 
count() %>% 
arrange(desc(n))
#Issue: These numbers seem too low. Im trying to view how many players there are in the power 5 conferneces




#What I want to do here is make a value that says power_five and have that be equal to "Big Ten", "Big 12", "ACC", "SEC', "Pac-12" so that when I filter I can say Filter to show me only players in the power_five conferences. I want to do this instead of having to filter and write a logner and/or statment

#Why does this not show everyone in p5 from maryland? Many people missing? What I want to happen is show players who are in p5 and from Maryland as a home state.

#how many players in P5 are from Maryland?      
#The %in% works with filtering on the list.

from_maryland_p5 <-  wbb_rosters_22_23 %>%
filter(conference %in% power_five) %>% 
filter (state_clean == "MD")

#compare to other states per capita... 

from_maryland_p5 %>% 
group_by(hometown_clean) %>% 
count()
#Is the story here that Maryland, a big ten state, doesn't produce players to Power 5?

# 8 players are in the ACC and Big Ten
conference_md <-from_maryland_p5 %>% 
group_by(conference) %>% 
count()
# One is in the pac-12. UCLA is the school and they are moving to the Big Ten.

#Showing a breakdown of the divisions?


```
*** For the story: Do I start larger and then work my way down in terms of scope and make this more of a list story? ***

```{r}
divison_breakdown <- wbb_rosters_22_23 %>% 
filter(state_clean == "MD") %>% 
group_by(division) %>% 
count() %>% 
arrange(desc(n))
# Maryland produces more D3 players than D1... D1 is more because it includes all conferences and not limited to P5 schools.... in genearl there are more D3 players because it's less competitive and no athletic scholarships.



```

#I think I need to join the populations to the state_counts dataframe to then do a mutate and identify number of WBB players per capita in each state.  

# Would I need to change the city names to be accurate with the census stuff
