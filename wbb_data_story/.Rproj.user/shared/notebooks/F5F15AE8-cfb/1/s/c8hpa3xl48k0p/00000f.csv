"0","#The code I went with tries to balance out things from both sides of the ball. I'm sure there is a combination that produces a lower standard error score which would make a stronger relationship but getting it to a 12 down from 22 is good in my book. It also produced a high R-squared closer to 1 which means that there is something correlated about these figures in determining the point differental of a game. "
