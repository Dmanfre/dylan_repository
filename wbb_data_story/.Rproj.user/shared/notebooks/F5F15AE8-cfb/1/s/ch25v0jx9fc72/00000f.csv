"0","# I kept getting an error saying invalid langugae so I used ChatGPT to tell me that what I was doing wrong was originally writing the code like this model1 <- logs %>% lm(differential ~ Penalties, data=logs) summary(model1)... the error was that I did not need the first logs. I only needed to set the data equal to logs."

"0","#In a paragraph below this code block, describe the results: what is the p-value, and does it mean the results are random? Using the r-squared value, how much of the differential can be explained by penalty yards? How useful is this regression?"
"0","  "
"0","#The p-value is 0.0158 or 2%. This is low but not as low as we have seen before in other examples. The R-Squared value is close to 0 which means there is not much of a correlation to this data. The regression is not successful because there is a very high Risidual Standard of Error in the 20s. I think you go off the R value when you say that less than 1% of the value can be explained by the penalty yards. "
