"0","#This gave me a very low residual standard of error score but a lower R-squared score as well. What this tells me is that maybe the factors I chose work well in games with a higher differential than those with a lower one. I also think that there is more of a situational relationship here that theres a stronger correlation wtih higher point differentials rather than in close games. Would this mean that penalties don't always influence the point differentials of close games?"
