Establishing my steps

```{r}

# What are my steps here and can I create a loop from it?
# import the dataset wbb_rosters_22_23
# establish the power_five list power_five <- c("SEC", "Big Ten", "Pac-12", "Big 12", "ACC")



#Try to set this up so that the code is underneith a sentence that I would write in the story. 


```

*** Genearl notes *****

Thinking of making this story more of a listical piece where I provide a graphic that answers questions I have when writing the code and analyzing the data. Each section of the story would be an answered question about the women's basketball data. And all of them will be relating back to Maryland or Power 5 at large.


General questions
- Do I start national and work down to a more local level?
- Do I include schools that are moving into the Big Ten in the latest 23-24 data?
- 

Story questions to be analyzed by the data
- Where to women's basketball players in Maryland come from


Steps
- Generate the numbers per capita for the state and then the local towns
- Get state populations by using Census API 
- 



```{r}
#libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
#install.packages("ipumsr")
library(ipumsr)

```

```{r}

#Loading in the data from 22-23 season

wbb_rosters_22_23 <- read_csv("data/wbb_rosters_2022_23.csv")
head(wbb_rosters_22_23)

#Loading in 23-24 data when I have it
#wbb_rosters_22_23 <- read_csv("data/wbb_rosters_2022_23.csv")
#head(wbb_rosters_22_23)



```







** Running some basic analysis **


```{r}
#state counts

wbb_rosters_22_23 %>% 
group_by(state_clean) %>%
filter(state_clean == "MD") %>% 
count()
##Maryland has 350


wbb_rosters_22_23 %>% 
group_by(state_clean) %>%
count() %>% 
arrange(desc(n))
#1073 NAs

wbb_rosters_22_23 %>% 
filter(is.na(state_clean))

wbb_rosters_22_23 %>% 
group_by(conference) %>% 
count() %>% 
arrange(desc(n))

#What I want to do here is make a value that says power_five and have that be equal to "Big Ten", "Big 12", "ACC", "SEC', "Pac-12" so that when I filter I can say Filter to show me only players in the power_five conferences. I want to do this instead of having to filter and write a logner and/or statment

power_five <- c("SEC", "Big Ten", "Pac-12", "Big 12", "ACC")

wbb_rosters_22_23 %>%
filter(conference == power_five)


#Question: should I include the new incoming Big Ten teams into this code block?

#Why does this not show everyone in p5 from maryland? Many people missing? What I want to happen is show players who are in p5 and from Maryland as a home state.

#how many players in P5 are from Maryland?      
#The %in% works with filtering on the list.

from_maryland_p5 <-  wbb_rosters_22_23 %>%
filter(conference %in% power_five) %>% 
filter (state_clean == "MD")

#compare to other states per capita... 

from_maryland_p5 %>% 
group_by(hometown_clean) %>% 
count()
#Is the story here that Maryland, a big ten state, doesn't produce players to Power 5?

# 8 players are in the ACC and Big Ten
conference_md <-from_maryland_p5 %>% 
group_by(conference) %>% 
count()
# One is in the pac-12. UCLA is the school and they are moving to the Big Ten.

#Showing a breakdown of the divisions?


```
*** For the story: Do I start larger and then work my way down in terms of scope and make this more of a list story? ***

```{r}
divison_breakdown <- wbb_rosters_22_23 %>% 
filter(state_clean == "MD") %>% 
group_by(division) %>% 
count() %>% 
arrange(desc(n))
# Maryland produces more D3 players than D1... D1 is more because it includes all conferences and not limited to P5 schools.... in genearl there are more D3 players because it's less competitive and no athletic scholarships.



```

```{r}



```


** Steps for the census data **
- Get dataframe of Maryland populations





*** Beginning to work on the section with Census Data ***

```{r}
#API key
Sys.setenv(CENSUS_API_KEY = "5cb2b9c628a1d1329c5bf4d36fe4435c6501efc8", overwrite = TRUE)

#2021 ACS
ACS_2021 <- load_variables(2021, "acs5")

#Get this to show the population data of all the Maryland towns
md_2021 <- get_acs(geography = "place",
                variables = c(population = "B01003_001"),      
              state = "MD",
              year = 2021) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2021)
#GEOID will be key to matching the places up together. 

```
