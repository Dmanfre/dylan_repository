# Working Lede
# With the women's basketball season approaching, let's analyze player origins.
# Maryland has a diverse group of players this season.

# Where are D-I players from in Maryland
# Maryland has 133 Division I women's basketball players, and they come from various locations.
# About 18% of them play for Power 5 institutions.

Showing number of power 5 vs Mid-Major
```{r}
p5_vs_mm <- division_one_md %>%
  mutate(p5_or_mm = case_when(
    conference %in% power_five ~ "power_five",

Exploration: There are 109 players in Mid Major Programs from Maryland. 
```{r}

Cleaning high schools and hometowns 

What I'm doing here is standardizing the HS's of Maryland players 
```{r}

    hs_clean == "St. Frances Academy (Maryland)" ~ "St. Francis Academy",

    hs_clean == "Baltimore Polytechnic Institute" ~ "Baltimore Poly Institute",
    hs_clean == "Eleanor Roosevelt H.S." ~ "Eleanor Roosevelt",
    hs_clean == "Frederick High School" ~ "Frederick HS",
    hs_clean == "McDonogh High School" | hs_clean ==  "McDonogh School" ~ "McDonogh",
    hs_clean == "Paint Branch High School|Paintbranch" ~ "Paint Branch HS",
    hs_clean == "Riverdale Baptist School" ~ "Riverdale Baptist",
    hs_clean == "Roland Park County School" ~ "Roland Park Country School",
