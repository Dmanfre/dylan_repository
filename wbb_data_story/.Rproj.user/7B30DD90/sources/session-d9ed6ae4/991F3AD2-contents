Establishing my steps

```{r}

# What are my steps here and can I create a loop from it?
# import the dataset wbb_rosters_22_23
# establish the power_five list power_five <- c("SEC", "Big Ten", "Pac-12", "Big 12", "ACC")
#

#Loading in the data from 22-23 season

** Running some basic analysis **


```{r}
#state counts

wbb_rosters_22_23 %>% 
group_by(state_clean) %>%
filter(state_clean == "MD") %>% 
count()
##Maryland has 350


wbb_rosters_22_23 %>% 
group_by(state_clean) %>%
count() %>% 
arrange(desc(n))
#1073 NAs

wbb_rosters_22_23 %>% 
filter(is.na(state_clean))

wbb_rosters_22_23 %>% 
group_by(conference) %>% 
count() %>% 
arrange(desc(n))

#What I want to do here is make a value that says power_five and have that be equal to "Big Ten", "Big 12", "ACC", "SEC', "Pac-12" so that when I filter I can say Filter to show me only players in the power_five conferences. I want to do this instead of having to filter and write a logner and/or statment

power_five <- c("SEC", "Big Ten", "Pac-12", "Big 12", "ACC")

wbb_rosters_22_23 %>%
filter(conference == power_five)


#Question: should I include the new incoming Big Ten teams into this code block?

#Why does this not show everyone in p5 from maryland? Many people missing? What I want to happen is show players who are in p5 and from Maryland as a home state.

#how many players in P5 are from Maryland?      
#The %in% works with filtering on the list.

from_maryland_p5 <-  wbb_rosters_22_23 %>%
filter(conference %in% power_five) %>% 
filter (state_clean == "MD")

#compare to other states per capita... 

from_maryland_p5 %>% 
group_by(hometown_clean) %>% 
count()
#Is the story here that Maryland, a big ten state, doesn't produce players to Power 5?

# 8 players are in the ACC and Big Ten
from_maryland_p5 %>% 
group_by(conference) %>% 
count()
# One is in the pac-12. UCLA is the school and they are moving to the Big Ten.

#Showing a breakdown of the divisions?


```
*** For the story: Do I start larger and then work my way down in terms of scope and make this more of a list story? ***

```{r}
divison_breakdown <- wbb_rosters_22_23 %>% 
filter(state_clean == "MD") %>% 
group_by(division) %>% 
count() %>% 
arrange(desc(n))
# Maryland produces more D3 players than D1... D1 is more because it includes all conferences and not limited to P5 schools.... in genearl there are more D3 players because it's less competitive and no athletic scholarships.
